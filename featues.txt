lcr delay

flanger
-> working

chorus


phaser
-> working

reverb
-> working

tremolo/panning
-> working

ring modulator

waveshaper
-> working

dynamics processor:

compressor/limiter
-> working

expander/gate
-> working

envelope detector
-> working (parameters need matching)

spectral compressor

envelope follower

second input line

oversampling:
- pad each sample with n-1 zeros (n is oversampling-factor)
- kill all freqs above the original nyquist-freq
. do processing
- kill all freqs above the original nyquist-freq again
- drop every added sample
-> creates delay of n-1-samples
