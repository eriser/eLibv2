filters:

resonant filters (HPF and LPF)
-> working as first- and second-order (cutoff and q matched)

resonant filters (BPF and BSF)
-> working as second-order (cutoff and q/bw matched)

allpass filter
->working as first- and second-order

shelving filters
-> working as second-order (cutoff matched)

butterworth filters (BPF, BSF, HPF and LPF)
-> working (cutoff and bw matched)

linkwitz-riley filters
-> working (cutoff matched)

peaking filters constant-q
-> working (cutoff, q and gain matched)

cascaded graphic eq constant-q
-> working (cutoff, q and gain matched)

effects:

sync to host tempo
-> in progress

delay-line
-> working

stereo crossed-feedback delay
-> working

multi-tap delay
-> working

ping-pong delay

lcr delay

flanger
-> working

chorus


phaser
-> working

reverb
-> working

tremolo/panning

ring modulator

waveshaper

dynamics processor:

compressor/limiter
-> working

expander/gate
-> working

envelope detector
-> working (parameters need matching)

spectral compressor

envelope follower

second input line

oversampling:
- pad each sample with n-1 zeros (n is oversampling-factor)
- kill all freqs above the original nyquist-freq
. do processing
- kill all freqs above the original nyquist-freq again
- drop every added sample
-> creates delay of n-1-samples
