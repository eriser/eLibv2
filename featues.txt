reverb


dynamics processor:

compressor
-> in progress

expander
limiter
gate

envelope detector
-> working (parameters need matching)

envelope follower

second input line

oversampling:
- add n-1 zeros between each sample (n is oversampling-factor)
- kill all freqs above the regular nyquist-freq
. do processing
- kill all freqs above the regular nyquist-freq again
- drop every added sample
